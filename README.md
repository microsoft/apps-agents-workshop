# Intelligent Apps & Agents Workshop

> **Repo:** `microsoft/apps-agents-workshop`  
> **Status:** Actively maintained and evolving. Contributions welcome.

## TL;DR

This repository hosts a hands-on workshop for building **Intelligent Apps and Agents** using Microsoft Power Platform. It includes labs, facilitator guidance, and supporting assets that cover: **Plan Designer**, **In-App Agents**, **Agent Flows**, **Advanced Approvals**, and early content for **Autonomous Agents**.

## Why this workshop

Modern business apps benefit from:

- **Agents embedded in the app experience** (e.g., data exploration, visualization, data entry, summarization).
- **Agents that orchestrate multi-step work** (e.g., flows and approvals).

This workshop reflects our “**apps need agents and agents need apps**” approach and prepares makers to deliver end-to-end scenarios with responsible, governed AI.

## Who this is for

- Power Platform makers (citizen & pro devs)  
- Solution architects, PMs, and workshop facilitators  
- Customer-facing roles delivering intelligent app solutions
